# Angular project with tailwindcss

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.1.1 with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) v3.4.0 integration.

## Features

- **Angular 20** - Latest version with enhanced performance and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Modern UI** - Clean, responsive design using Tailwind components

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4201/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Tailwind CSS

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Here's how to use it:

### Using Utility Classes

Simply add Tailwind's utility classes to your HTML elements:

```html
<div class="flex items-center justify-center p-4 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-lg shadow-md">
  This is styled with Tailwind CSS
</div>
```

### Customizing Tailwind

You can customize Tailwind by editing the `tailwind.config.js` file in the project root.

### Documentation

For full documentation on Tailwind CSS, visit [https://tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
